# comments start with octothorpe and run to the end of the line.
# blank lines are ignored.

# a quantity of cards is represented by a single line:
4 SET Card Oracle Name

# the first token is of the form `[0-9]+x?`
# the second token is a 3+ character set code, all uppercase: `[A-Z][A-Z0-9]{2+}`
# the rest of the line (excluding leading / trailing whitespace) is
#   taken as the oracle card name, irrespective of case.

# variants are specified by following the oracle card name with a pipe character,
# and then one or more variation specifiers.
#
# for example, this is a foiled Opt from Dominaria:
#
1 DOM Opt | foil

# this is a promo (both promo and foil):
1 ELD Once Upon a Time | promo foil

# variation specifiers in parentheses are reserved for collector use,
# allowing collectors to make up new variations, ad hoc.
#
1 3ED Clone | (signed: Signed by the artist)

# grading and condition can be set as a variant, using CK codes
# (NM, EX, VG, G):
4 DOM Cancel | NM
3 DOM Cancel | VG
1 DOM Cancel | G

# because of the whitespace insensitivity on the oracle card name,
# you can (and should) line up the pipes for legibility:

1x DOM Opt               | NM foil
1x DOM Cancel            | NM
1x DOM Cancel            | NM (signed)
1x ELD Once Upon a Time  | promo foil
