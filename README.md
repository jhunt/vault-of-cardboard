Vault of Cardboard
==================

This is the code that runs <https://vaultofcardboard.com>.

Developer Tasks
===============

This section contains my personal notes on how to do stuff with
this codebase, since I touch it so infrequently and my children
have utterly destroyed my memory banks.

Hacking on the Vault
--------------------

This repository contains a Docker Compose recipe that is suitable
for doing Rust development _outside_ of the Docker Image build
pipeline (by essentially bind-mounting in the `cardboard` binary).
This recipe is stored in `dev-env.yml` -- a non-standard file for
Docker Compose.  That's why we have this lovely `./hack` script:

    ./hack up       # spin up the env
    ./hack up -d    # the same, in the background
    ./hack down     # spin it down again

In reality, `./hack` is little more than a wrapper around the
`docker-compose` command, with the correct arguments to name the
containers and locate the recipe file.

It does however have some smarts around ingesting sets locally and
rescrying â€“ two activities that have proven problematic in the
past:

    ./hack ingest IKO NEO AFR     # ingest 3 new sets and rescry


Run the Integration Tests
-------------------------

Testing VCB requires more than just a `cargo test`.  Luckily, if
you have Docker and Docker-compose installed locally, the Makefile
has everything in it you need to set up the required integration.

To run _just_ the unit-tests, and automatically spinning the
supporting infrastructure (Postgres, Redis, etc.):

    make unit-tests

Integration tests, which run against a compiled API server running
locally, require a bit more finesse.  First, we have to spin up
the integration infrastructure:

    make integration-api

(That really ought to run in a separate terminal, via tmux)

Then, you can run the full integration test suite via:

    make integration-tests

If you want to run both unit and integration tests, and already
have the integration-api target running in the background, you can
just use:

    make test

A more fun developer workflow, however, is to use the
`watch-and-test` target to wait for changes to the Rust code on
the filesystem, and automatically re-run tests against the
integration infrastructure:

    make watch-and-test

I usually run this from one half of a split tmux pane, and then
fire up vim in the other half for hacking.


Browse a Development Copy
-------------------------

If you already have the integration API spinning for your tests,
you can set up a local web UI for browsing on loopback via the
`./test/nginx` script.  Execute this from a separate terminal, and
it will bring up a web server on `localhost:3001`, which you can
use to try out the Javascript.


Docker Images
-------------

In the root of this repository are multiple Dockerfiles, each
with a suffix identifying the container image it builds:

**Dockefile.ux** - An nginx-derived image that brings serves
static HTML / JS / CSS / etc. files that make up web user
interface for Vault of Cardboard.

**Dockerfile.api** - The backend API of Vault of Cardboard.
This is the thing that does collection management, authentication,
deck and goal munging, etc.

**Dockerfile.deps** - This contains the "outer shell" of the image
that the `Dockerfile.api` recipe builds, and it is used by the
development environment (see "Hacking on the Vault", above) to
scaffold a bind-mounted copy of the `cardboard` binary.
