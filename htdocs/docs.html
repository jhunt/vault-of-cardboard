<h1>Vault of Cardboard Query Language</h1>
<p>This section describes how to write queries against the Vault.</p>

<p>The simplest of Vault queries consist of single unquoted words
(i.e.: <kbd>counterspell</kbd>), and quoted strings (i.e.: <kbd>"Blur Sliver"</kbd>).
These queries match cards based on their names.  The unquoted
variety is case-insensitive, but matches whole words &mdash; <kbd>ral</kbd>
would match <em>Ral, Caller of Storms</em>, but not <em>Baral, Chief of
Compliance</em>.</p>

<p>More advanced expressions exist for matching against other parts
of the card.  For example, <kbd>color:W</kbd> is an expression that matches
cards whose color identity includes white.</p>

<p>Here's a list of all the expression types currently supported by
the Vault interpreter.  Feel free to skim this list upon first
encountering it, and then return once you get to see how
expressions can be combined!</p>

      Valid epoch-based frames are:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1993</strong> The original layout, from Alpha through Alliances.</li>
        <li><strong>1997</strong> The revised frame, in use from Mirage (late '96) to Scourge.</li>
        <li><strong>2003</strong> (also called <strong>modern</strong>) The "modern" frame, introduced
        in 8th Edition and in use until Core 2015.</li>
        <li><strong>2015</strong> (also called <strong>current</strong>) The frame for new sets, printed today.</li>
        <li><strong>future</strong> The time-shifted frame from Future Sight (and not seen before or since).</li>
      </ul>
      <!--
      <br><br>
      Besides the base frames, there are several compositional frame <em>attributes</em> that can also be specified
      with the <tt>frame</tt> qualifier:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>color-shifted</strong> Planar Chaos had color-shifted cards.</li>
        <li><strong>companion</strong> Ikoria introduced the concept of companion, with a new frame treatment.</li>
        <li><strong>compass</strong> Ixalan gave as the <em>explore</em> mechanic, and with it, the transforming compass frame.</li>
        <li><strong>devoid</strong> Zendikar gave us the Eldrazi, the first non-artifact colorless spells.</li>
        <li><strong>draft</strong>Conspiracy (and Conspiracy 2) introduced draft-specicif cards like Schemes.  This matches those.</li>
        <li><strong>extended-art</strong> With so-called <em>extended art</em> cards, the art is stretched to beyond the normal borders of a Magic card.</li>
        <li><strong>legendary</strong> The legendary crown, that appears on more recent <em>legendary creature</em> permanent cards.
        <li><strong>miracle</strong> Innistrad gave us the <em>miracle</em> mechanic, with its own sunburst frame.</li>
        <li><strong>nyx</strong> <em>Nyx-touched</em> cards from the plane of Theros have a different background color texture.</li>
        <li><strong>showcase</strong> The showcase frame features new art, in a completely different card frame.</li>
        <li><strong>tombstone</strong> Introduced in Odyssey, the <em>flashback</em> mechanic saw cards gain a small tombstone in the top left corner.</li>

<p>Several of these typed expressions are so common that VCB has
either a shorthand or keyword notation for them.</p>

<p class="note"><span>Note:</span>
if you want to match keywords as a name, for instance if you were
looking for <em>Hour of Need</em>, you can use the <kbd>name:</kbd> expression, as in
<kbd>name:"Need"</kbd>.  (Due to a technical limitation that should be fixed soon,
you do have to quote the value, which means capitalization matters!)</p>

<p>For anything but the simplest queries, you're going to want to
combine these expressions into larger aggregate expressions.  For these, you
need the <em>logical operators</em>: <kbd>and</kbd>, <kbd>or</kbd>, and <kbd>not</kbd>.</p>

<p><kbd>and</kbd> works by checking both sub-expressions; if those both match, the
expression as a whole is a match.  <kbd>or</kbd> considers the whole expression a
match if <em>either</em> sub-expression is a match.  This mirrors how we use the
words "and" / "or" in English.</p>

<p>For example, there are a lot of legendary creatures.  To build a blue / black
commander (EDH) deck,  I need to find an interesting legendary creature who
is both blue and black.  That's two expressions, stitched together with an
<kbd>and</kbd>:</p>

<pre><code class="query">type:legendary and color:UB</code></pre>

<p>The <kbd>not</kbd> operator lets you negate an assertion.  Commander doesn't
generally allow Planeswalkers to serve as Commanders, and since most walkers
are listed as "Legendary Planeswalkers", I need to amend my query to
exclude all mention of the sub-type:</p>

<pre><code class="query">type:legendary and color:UB and not type:planeswalker</code></pre>

<p>Much better.</p>

<p>In the interest of reducing keystrokes, <kbd>!</kbd> is an alias of <kbd>not</kbd>; forgive
me, this is my programmer roots showing.  A nice compact query that takes
advantage of all this terseness is:</p>

<pre><code class="query">owned and !=common</code></pre>

<p>... which finds all of the uncommons, rares, and mythic rares in your
collection.</p>

<h2>Uniqueness</h2>
<p>By default, Vault of Cardboard will return all prints and editions of a <em>card</em>.
For example, if you search for <kbd>counterspell</kbd>, you'll get a bunch of them, mostly
reprints.  If you don't care about specific editions, and are just looking for the general
counterspell card, you can add <kbd>and unique</kbd> to the end of your search query.</p>

<p>There are two modes for the <kbd>unique</kbd> predicate: oracle text and art.</p>

<p>For <strong>oracle text</strong>, use <kbd>unique:card</kbd>, or the briefer shortcut
<kbd>unique</kbd>.  As it compiles the search results, Vault of Cardboard will omit duplicates
of reprinted cards.  Note that this may not always return the <em>original</em> printing.</p>

<p>Sometimes cards get a reprint with new art.  To find all unique illustrations, you can use
the <strong>card art</strong> mode: <kbd>unique:art</kbd>.</p>

<p>This type of filtering is different from all of the other query predicates, since it
has to take into account all of the cards seen so far.  As such, you will probably see some
strange behavior if you try to nest the uniqueness predicate inside of a subquery.</p>

<p>For 99% of use cases, you'll want to just tack on a <kbd>and unique</kbd> to the end of
your query.</p>

<h2>A Note About Precedence</h2>
<p>Finally, we need to talk about precedence.  Whenever you chain multiple
<kbd>and</kbd>'s and <kbd>or</kbd>'s together, you need to consider what you actually mean.
For example:</p>

<pre><code class="query">owned and =rare or =mythic</code></pre>

<p>The <em>intent</em> behind this query was to find all my rares.  Unfortunately, the
precedence rules of the query language <em>bind</em> the <kbd>owned</kbd> and <kbd>=rare</kbd>
sub-expressions together, and then checks the <kbd>=mythic</kbd> status.  The upshot
is that what I actually get is all of my owned rares, and every mythic rare
ever printed.</p>

<p>I could reword the query to be:</p>

<pre><code class="query">=rare or =mythic and owned</code></pre>

<p>(in general, <kbd>and owned</kbd> on the end will almost always do what you want)</p>

<p>Luckily, you can use parentheses to enforce the precedence you want, without
having to reword:</p>

<pre><code class="query">owned and (=mythic or =rare)</code></pre>

<p>This causes the rarity expressions to be evaluated, and then checked against
ownership status.  Just like math class!</p>

<h2>A Query Cookbook</h2>

<p>If you prefer to learn by doing, or just want to try some things
out, this is the section for you.</p>

<p><strong>What do I own from <em>Dominaria</em>?</strong></p>

<pre><code class="query">set:DOM and owned</code></pre>

<p><strong>What red playsets do I own?</strong> (i.e. for standard deck
construction purposes)</p>

<pre><code class="query">@R and own:4+</code></pre>

<p><strong>What taplands exist?</strong></p>

<pre><code class="query">type:Land and +tapped</code></pre>

<p><strong>I would like to drool over Zendikar lands please</strong></p>

<pre><code class="query">set:ZEN or set:BFZ and type:land and type:basic</code></pre>

<p>or (if you like parentheticals (as I do)):</p>

<pre><code class="query">(set:ZEN or set:BFZ) and (type:land and type:basic)</code></pre>

<p><strong>Oh man do I love a good life transfer card!</strong></p>

<pre><code class="query">+gains? and +loses?</code></pre>

<p><strong>What white weenies have lifelink?</strong></p>

<pre><code class="query">@W and +lifelink and pt:1/1</code></pre>

<p><strong>What GRN creatures had more attack than defense?</strong></p>

<pre><code class="query">set:GRN and ptr:&gt;1</code></pre>
