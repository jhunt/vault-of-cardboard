  title:   Story Spotlights, Uniqueness, and Deck Imports
  dated:   July 3rd 2019
  notes: |
    <p>We've made some adjustments to search.  For those of you who just can't get
    enough of the deep lore of M:tG expansion sets, we have a new search predicate,
    <kbd>spotlight</kbd> that finds <em>Story Spotlight</em> cards.</p>

    <p>The biggest new feature for VQL, however, has got to be <em>uniqueness</em>
    filtering.  There have been lots of cards printed over the years, and a sizable
    chunk of those are reprints.  We've always had the <kbd>reprint</kbd> predicate,
    but that doesn't work when you're trying to limit to recent sets.</p>

    <p>Now, you can drop all those pesky duplicates by adding <kbd>and unique</kbd>
    to the end of your search query.  Any additional prints of any given card will
    be removed from the resultset, cleaning things up.  This is perfect for deck
    brewing, where you care more about the oracle text than the print edition or
    pricing.</p>

    <p>If you love the art of Magic as much as we do, you'll also love the new
    <em>art uniqueness</em> predicate too!  With <kbd>unique:art</kbd>, you'll get
    rid of duplicate card art in your resultset.</p>

    <p>This release also marks the introduction of <em>preview features</em>;
    stuff we want to get into the hands of users, but that aren't ready for prime
    time just yet.  The first of those is Deck Import.  You can export decks from
    your favorite deck builder sites, and import them into the Vault.  Afterwards,
    you can use the new <kbd>in:deck-name</kbd> predicate to filter based on
    inclusion in a given deck.  Now you can find all those Ninja's that <em>aren't</em>
    in your Yuriko deck.</p>

    <p>Contact James if you want early access to preview features!</p>

  title:   Buy / Sell / Trade Collection Management (BETA)
  dated:   May 3rd 2019
  notes: |
    <p>Okay, we've been working on this one for a long time, so bear with us...</p>

    <p>Vault of Cardboard's collection management facilities just got a major boost.
    No longer are you required to manage a single listing of all the cards in your
    entire collection.  Instead, you can start with an initial import, and then use
    <em>Buy</em> and <em>Sell</em> events to add cards to, and remove cards from your
    collection.</p>

    <p>I started doing this when I first got back into Magic, using spreadsheets and
    some cobbled-together scripts to consolidate all the data.  I found it useful to
    be able to go through and figure out when I got what cards, where they came from
    (did I buy packs?  singles?  did someone gift them to me?), etc.</p>

    <p>Now you can do that too!  Keep in mind, this is still in beta, and probably
    has lots of bugs and corner cases that we haven't had a chance to suss out.</p>

    <p>Oh, and if you need an account (we're still in closed registration), let us know!</p>

  notes: |
    <p>It's officially War of the Spark Prerelease Weekend, so we've added
    <a href="#!/q/set:WAR">the <code>WAR</code> set</a> to Vault's database.
    Have fun spelunking through all that new <em>amass</em> / <em>proliferate</em>
    goodness, and drooling over those new walkers!</p>

  title:   Tokens, Flip Cards, and Color Splash!
  dated:   March 5th, 2019
  notes: |
    <p>We now have card data on Tokens!  You can find tokens the same way
    you find any other card, since the word "Token" shows up in their type
    line: <code>type:token</code> works like a champ.  The Vault even supports
    those pesky double-faced tokens from the Ravnica Guild Kits (GK1 / GK2).</p>

    <p>Like flip cards?  Then you'll love the new <em>flippy</em> UI widget we've
    added to the Kamigawa flip cards, and the Innistrad transform cards.  Click
    the little rotate-y icon in the bottom right corner of a multi-faced card
    and the other card face will be shown.  The modal card view even blows up
    whatever face is shown in the grid!</p>

    <p>Finally, the color breakdown of the entire search resultset is now encoded
    in a 5-color bar at the top of the page.  Ever wonder who has the most draw-based
    damage?  Just search for <a href="#!/q/+draw%20and+damage">+draw
    and +damage</a> and you'll get immediate confirmation that it's mostly a
    blue / red thing.</p>

  title:   Even More Search Niceties
  dated:   March 3rd, 2019
  notes: |
    <p>The <a href="#!/docs">Vault of Cardboard Query Language</a> now
    handles adjacent <em>bare word</em> identifiers as parts of a card name.
    That means you can now search <code>lady of scrolls</code> rather than
    the (less specific) <code>lady AND of AND scrolls</code>.  We've caught
    ourselves just typing card names into the search bar one too many times
    to not just fix this.</p>

    <p>Loading screens look prettier, but here's hoping you don't have to
    spend enough time looking at them to notice...</p>

  title:   My Pretties...
  dated:   March 2nd, 2019
  notes: |
    <p>This update has a whole bunch of visual tweaks and improvements,
    as well as a long-overdue addition to the querying capability.</p>

    <p>The Vault now supports a <code>legal:...</code> predicate, allowing
    you to refine your card search based on ban lists and pre-constructed
    format rules.  It's never been easier to stay within the confines of
    Modern, Vintage, Legacy, Standard, Brawl, and EDH/Commander.</p>

    <p>Also, the <em>unusual</em> card formats are now queryable!  The Vault
    now lets you search for cards based on their card layout, so you can finally
    find all those splits, transform cards, melds, and flippies.</p>

    <p>For prerelease and spoilers, Scryfall uses low-resolution digitals,
    so our RNA card faces looked bad.  Those have been refreshed,
    and the backend systems updated to avoid that in the future, as new
    sets are released.</p>

    <p>We now also have a "blank" card face which browsers will load before
    attempting to fetch the actual card faces.  This makes the whole user
    experience way nicer on slower links (i.e. conference / airport wifi).</p>

  title:   Mobile Support, Ravnica Allegiance, and More
  dated:   January 25th, 2019
  notes: |
    <p><a href="#!/q/set:RNA">Ravnica Allegiance is out!</a>
    We've got all the cards and all the images for the newest set, where we get to
    play as the other five Ravnican guilds: Orzhov, Rakdos, Simic, Gruul, and Azorius.</p>

    <p>The Vault now supports mobile browsing, both on small screens (like my ancient
    iPhone 5s) and tablet-sized displays (like my wife's iPad Pro).  Try it out and see
    what you think!  Now you can check the prices, oracle text, errata, and other card
    details, wherever you are.  We use it to settle disputes mid-game!</p>

    <p>We've done a bunch of other various updates, tweaks and fixes as well:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Collection imports are now normalized</strong> to a single entry
      per card+set, which can be helpful when you've got some last-minute additions
      to the collection and don't want to bother with deduplication yourself.</li>

      <li><strong>More Modal Card Detail.</strong>  When you click on a card to get
      more information, you now get the title, card type, and oracle text, along
      the right-hand side of the modal.  Useful for copying / pasting into your favorite
      chat software, or M:tG forum.  We also integrated mana and tap symbols.</li>

      <li><strong>Pricing is formatted more sanely now;</strong> <em>$120.0</em> is
      just plain embarassing.  For ludicrously expensive cards (looking at you, Reserve
      List), we now gently remind you that cardboard is a poor investment vehicle.</li>

      <li><strong>All tables are now click-sortable.</strong>  Too many have suffered
      with the inability to sort random tables by header columns.  No more!</li>
    </ul>

  title:   New Query Language Predicates / Set Listing Updates
  dated:   January 9th, 2019
  notes: |
    <p>We have some new predicates in the query language that let you do some
    pretty spicy stuff.  Use <code>artist:...</code> to find the prints by the
    artists you love.  The new power / toughness predicates (<code>p/t/pt/cpt/ptr</code>)
    will finally let us brew that killer <a href="#!/q/Wild Pair">Wild Pair</a>
    deck for some sweet library-to-battlefield shenanigans.</p>

    <p>Oh!  The <a href="#!/sets">Set Listing Page</a> got some love too; we now
    track release dates (in a sortable table) so you can look through the sets
    (reverse) chronologically, if you're into that sort of thing.  We also lined up
    the set icons, so they look prettier.  Visuals matter!</p>

  dated:   January 4th, 2019
  notes: |
    <p>We were missing some images from random sets,  The ingestion process
    now properly (and intelligently!) backfills missing images from Scryfall.
    We have always hosted our own copies of the card images (front and back),
    to ease load on Scryfalls bottom-line, now we're just better at it.</p>

  title:   Docs, Fixes, and a UI Overhaul &mdash; Ooh! Shiny!!
  dated:   January 1st, 2019
  notes: |
    <p>Vault of Cardboard gets a redesign!  The old full-art land login box is gone,
    as is the annoying old front page.  We here at the Vault pride ourselves on the
    visual, aesthetic nature of the site, so this is kind of a big deal for us.</p>

    <p>We also finally sat down and wrote out how to use the <a href="#!/docs">Vault
    of Cardboard Query Language</a> &mdash; it is definitely worth a read and may even
    teach you a few tricks you didn't already know!</p>

    <p>The <a href="#!/sets">Set Listing Page</a> is new, and it shows you what sets
    the Vault knows about.  Did we miss a set?  Let us know!</p>

  title:   Formats, Formats, Formats
  dated:   December 27th, 2018
  notes: |
    <p><abbr title="Vault of Cardboard">VCB</abbr> now supports additional import
    formats, including:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>TCGPlayer.com's <abbr title="comma-separated values">CSV</abbr> format</li>
      <li><a href="https://archidekt.com">Archidekt's</a> deck export format</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The super neat thing about the TCGPlayer support is that the importer
    will properly detect the fields it needs, in whatever order they appear in the
    CSV output, provided you include the header row.  This makes it possible to
    support other comma-separated formats natively!</p>

  title:   Welcome to the Vault!
  dated:   December, 2018
  notes: |
    <blockquote class="ed">I got back into Magic: the Gathering in the week
    leading up to Thanksgiving, 2018.  By early December, I had realized that
    I wanted a better search engine and collection management system.  I started
    working on Vault of Cardboard December 13th, and I think it was deployed
    to "production" sometime just after Christmas.
    <cite>jhunt</cite></blockquote>

    <p>This is it!  The historic (as in legendary!) initial public launch
    of Vault of Cardboard.  You've got deck ideas, and we've got a search
    engine for you, rivaling that of anything we've seen out there, and
    fueled by the inimitable Scryfall data.</p>

    <p>How does it work?  We regularly scrape card and pricing data from
    Scryfall (pursuant to their terms of service) and make it available
    in a visual, searchable database.  The <a href="#!/docs">Vault of
    Cardboard Query Language</a> gives you unprecedented power in searching
    the totality of printed Magic: the Gathering cards.</p>

    <p>Right now, we're in a bit of a closed+open beta, publicly-ish.
    The collection management aspects of the Vault are still under development,
    and are subject to change, so we have not yet made the user account signup
    process open to any or all.  However, you can still search the database
    even without an account!</p>
